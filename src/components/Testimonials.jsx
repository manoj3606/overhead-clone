      <p>Louise is extremely reliable and honest in carrying out a wide variety of tasks that ranges from the routine ones to being extremely resourceful to carry out complicated requests. She is extraordinarily efficient and there is very little back and forth in carrying out the tasks thus freeing up valuable time. You can also rely on her excellent judgement when the requests have a broad objective with little definition to lay out options for one to consider. Top of it, she has an excellent sense of humor and is a pleasure to deal with.</p>

      <p>Louise was recommended to me by someone I regard highly she has become my back bone in the business and someone whom I rely on more than she realises. It is such a comfort to know that she is embedded in my business as someone I can trust and supports me.</p>
